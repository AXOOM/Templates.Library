# MySolutionName

This repository contains the source code for the MySolutionName library.

Run `build.ps1` to compile the source code and package the library as a NuGet package.
This script takes a version number as an input argument. The source code itself contains no version numbers. Instead version numbers should be determined at build time using [GitVersion](gitversion.readthedocs.io).
